# InputFun

This project was created a while back as a "test" program, and is no longer actively maintained. I intended this to be a Bukkit plugin that I created for fun to test out my Java skills. Thanks for understanding.

```
A Minecraft Plugin I am working on that is supposed to relieve boredom for players in-game. Hope ya enjoy it!
```

###### *Was* a project I was working on back in 2014 or somewhere around there, was one of the first plugins I have made, and the first, and only Bukkit plugin I posted on the plugins page on BukkitDev I thinl.
